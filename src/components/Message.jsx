        Indian Institute of Information Technology Design and Manufacturing (IIITDM) Kurnool is the youngest among
five centrally funded IIITDMs and established as part of Andhra Pradesh reorganization act in the academic
year 2015-16 at the historical city of Kurnool in Rayalaseema region. <br />
Our Institute is recognized as an Institution of National Importance by an act of Parliament. The institute has a
permanent campus at Jagannatha Gattu, Dinnedevarapadu, Kurnool. The institute offers four undergraduate
programmes, namely, Computer Science and Engineering, Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, Electronics
and Communication Engineering and Mechanical Engineering, with a total annual intake of 240 students, three
MTech Programmes, namely, Data Analytics and Decision Sciences, Electronic System Design and Smart
manufacturing, with an annual intake of 45 students, and PhD programmes. <br />
Our campus is located at one of the most scenic locations of Kurnool in a vast 190 acres of land, making it a
best and pleasant place for young and aspiring students. Being adjacent to Nandyal â€“ Kadapa highway, the
institute is well connected to all parts of the country. <br />
All the faculty are highly qualified with PhD degrees from reputed institutes across India and outside India.
The Institute's goal is to provide aesthetically pleasing, environment-friendly green campus facilities to
enhance the learning, teaching and interdisciplinary research activities. The Institute has organized various
Techno-Cultural activities to enhance the practical learning and Industry Exposure of the students.
I am sure that our students and faculty will carry the flagship of IIITDM Kurnool to greater heights by applying
their knowledge in an interdisciplinary manner to provide solutions for various industrial, societal and
research and development projects and will stand as responsible and dedicated technocrats in the process of
nation buildving. <br /> <br />
I wish my students all the best in all their endeavors.
Jai Hind
